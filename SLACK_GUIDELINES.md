# Slack guidelines

LocalStack community uses Slack for real-time conversations and to communicate across the community. To make sure we are getting the best out of our Slack community, we have a few guidelines in place.

- **Follow our code of conduct**: LocalStack expects all the contributors to uphold the Contributor Covenant [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **Be nice, be respectful**: Be nice and respectful with all the community members. If someone sounds off, give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they meant well.
- **Use inclusive language**: Be mindful of not using words that are exclusionary in nature and should allow more diverse audience to engage with you.
- **Community support**: For all community support, please use the `community-support` channel. For inquiries about professional and enterprise support, use the `general` channel to express interest.
- **Avoid direct messages**: Slack is about communication and we prefer public messages to be used wherever we can. Please use direct messages for sales, inquiry into licensing and pro support.
