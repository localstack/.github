## What is LocalStack? ü§î

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) is a cloud development platform that facilitates building/testing of cloud and serverless applications on your local machine. At its core, it features a service emulator that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS applications or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider! Whether you are testing complex CDK applications or Terraform configurations, or just beginning to learn about AWS services, LocalStack helps speed up and simplify your testing and development workflow.

We are trusted by 10,000s of developers worldwide. Check out our Open-Source (OSS) [GitHub repository](https://github.com/localstack/localstack), or search on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=localstack)/[Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=LocalStack+AWS) to find out what people have to say about LocalStack. It's the modern way of developing cloud applications - we hope you're part of it!

## What does LocalStack do? ü§Ø

By emulating cloud services locally, LocalStack enables additional features and workflows that are not feasible on the cloud.

-   Save and restore your cloud infrastructure's state and data for team collaboration with [Cloud Pods](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/cloud-pods/).
-   Test your system's resilience by introducing errors and simulated latencies through [Chaos Engineering](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/chaos-engineering/).
-   Analyze team usage patterns of cloud services and resources with [Stack Insights](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/web-application/stack-insights/).
-   Create temporary cloud environments quickly to substitute for dedicated staging setups using [ephemeral environments](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/cloud-sandbox/).
-   Enhance LocalStack by integrating custom applications for specific workflows or development purposes with [extension mechanism](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/extensions/).

You can use various [LocalStack integrations](https://docs.localstack.cloud/integrations/) & [CI providers](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/ci/) to seamlessly integrate LocalStack into your existing development workflow. For an blazing fast developer experience, check out our [Web Application](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/web-application/), [Developer tools](https://docs.localstack.cloud/tools/) & [Lambda Tools](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/lambda-tools/) to help you develop and test your cloud applications.
